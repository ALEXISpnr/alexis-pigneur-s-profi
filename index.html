	   <p>Welcome to my website! 
	     My name is Alexis Pigneur, I'm an 18 year old student, strongly passionate about sports and art. As a judo and football enthusiast, I firmly believe that discipline and teamwork are essential, both on the mat and on the field. In addition, I love sharing my passion for drawing. I teach younger students and strive to awaken their creativity. This site is a space where I combine my passions, projects, and ideas. Join me on this dynamic journey!

	 <h2>Art, a passion born at a very early age</h2>
       <p>
         Since I was 5 years old, art has been a true driving force of creativity in my life. Through drawing, I learned to express my emotions, imagine new worlds, and turn my ideas into reality. Each stroke of the pencil allows me to explore my sensitivity and develop my perspective on the world. Above all, the experience of teaching drawing to younger students for two years has significantly deepened my appreciation for this art form, as I get to inspire their creativity while reinforcing my own skills. Art also taught me patience and perseverance qualities that I apply in my other passions, like judo and football. For me, creating is not just a hobby; it’s a way of life and a means to share my unique vision with others.

     <h2>Judo, an elegant combat sport</h2>
      <p>
    
         Judo, a sport I passionately practiced up to black belt level, taught me the beauty of discipline and respect. This elegant martial art is not just about strength; it's about technique, balance, and strategy. Each training session has challenged me to refine my skills, cultivate resilience, and embrace the spirit of brotherhood. Judo shaped my character, teaching me to overcome obstacles both on and off the mat. It’s a way for me to connect with my body and mind, pushing my limits while embodying the principles of humility and perseverance. The lessons I learned in judo resonate in all aspects of my life, making it an integral part of who I am.

     <h2>Football, the sport that makes me dream</h2>
       <p>
         Football has been a huge part of my life since I kicked my first ball at the age of 4. Those early moments on the field ignited a passion that has only grown stronger over the years. My dream of becoming a professional player has always driven me to push my limits, both in training and during matches. Every time I lace up my boots, I feel a rush of excitement.
         The thrill of scoring a goal or making a crucial pass brings me pure joy, and the friendships I’ve been building with my teammates are some of my most treasured memories. Football taught me about teamwork, resilience, and the importance of hard work. It’s not just a sport for me; it’s a journey that shapes who I am and inspires me to chase my dreams both on and off the field.
